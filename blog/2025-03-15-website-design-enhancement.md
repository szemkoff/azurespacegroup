## Website Design Enhancements

### Main Page Redesign

The Azure Space Group main page has been completely redesigned with a modern, cohesive design language. Key improvements include:

- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: New gradient hero banner and clearer content organization
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Direct links to key documentation sections from the main page
- **Technology Cards**: Interactive cards showcasing our core technologies with quick navigation links
- **Research Highlight Section**: Featured section for our latest breakthrough - the Quantum Battery Prototype
- **Consistent Button Styling**: Standardized button appearance across the site for better user experience

### Project Status Page Overhaul

We've completely redesigned the project status page to provide a clearer view of our development progress:

- **Technology Development Tracks**: Updated presentation of our six main research tracks with their current status
- **Improved Tables**: Enhanced table styling with hover effects and better spacing
- **Strategic Roadmap**: Clearer presentation of our development approach and methodology
- **Mobile Optimizations**: Responsive design adaptations for all screen sizes

### Consistent Design System

We've implemented a unified design system throughout the site, including:

- **Typography Hierarchy**: Consistent font styles and weights for headings and body text
- **Color System**: Standardized color palette for status indicators and interactive elements
- **Component Library**: Reusable components like feature cards, status indicators, and call-to-action buttons
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing and padding throughout the interface

## Documentation Improvements

Alongside the design enhancements, we've also made significant improvements to our documentation content:

### Quantum Battery Prototype Documentation

Our detailed documentation on the quantum battery prototype has been expanded to include:

- Comprehensive material requirements and specifications
- Step-by-step manufacturing procedures
- Component diagrams and assembly instructions
- Theoretical power output calculations

### Technology Documentation Updates

We've improved the clarity and organization of our core technology documentation:

- Added cross-references between related technologies
- Improved diagram quality and annotations
- Updated terminology to align with current research standards
- Enhanced explanation of complex quantum concepts

## Technical Implementation

These improvements were implemented using:

- **React and Docusaurus**: Core framework for documentation
- **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling with minimal conflicts
- **Responsive Design Principles**: Ensuring compatibility across devices
- **SVG Optimizations**: Lightweight vector graphics for diagrams and icons

## Future Plans

These design and documentation enhancements are just the beginning. We're working on several additional improvements:

1. **Interactive Diagrams**: Adding more interactive elements to help visualize complex quantum concepts
2. **Search Enhancements**: Improving search functionality to quickly find specific information
3. **Documentation Versioning**: Better tracking of changes and updates to our research

We appreciate your continued interest in the Azure Space Group project and welcome any feedback on these enhancements. Stay tuned for more updates as our research continues to progress!
