We are excited to announce a major set of updates to the Azure Space Group documentation and project resources!

## ðŸš€ What's New?

### 1. **Detailed Grant Program Pages**
We have added comprehensive pages for each major grant program relevant to our mission:
- Quantum Sci (Stanford University)
- UConn Quantum
- NSF Expand
- ARPA-E OPEN
- DOE Quantum
- NASA NIAC
- AFOSR Basic

Each page includes eligibility, application requirements, evaluation criteria, and actionable tips for success. Find them under **Investment Opportunities â†’ Grant Programs** in the sidebar.

### 2. **Investment Plan & Grant Program Guide**
Our [Investment Plan](/docs/investment) now features a full grant program overview, funding strategy, action plan, and best practices for successful applications. This will help guide our team and collaborators through the complex funding landscape.

### 3. **Expanded Sidebar Navigation**
The sidebar now includes direct links to each grant program, making it easier to find funding opportunities and application details.

### 4. **Development Roadmap Mind Map**
A new [Development Roadmap](/docs/development-roadmap) page visualizes our strategic pathways and priorities using a mind map, helping everyone understand our big-picture goals and next steps.

## ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters
- **Clarity:** Easier navigation and access to funding resources
- **Actionability:** Step-by-step guidance for grant applications
- **Transparency:** Clear roadmap and priorities for all contributors

We encourage all team members and collaborators to review these updates and use the new resources as you plan your work and funding strategies.

Stay tuned for more improvements and let us know if you have suggestions!
