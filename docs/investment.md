## Page 1: Company & Technology Overview

### Revolutionary Technology

Our quantum propulsion technology operates by generating a quantum cocoon around spacecraft that distorts all physical and quantum connections with the surrounding environment. This gives the vehicle absolute freedom of speed and maneuverability, with immunity from environmental resistance.

This technology is inspired by nature - flying insects have used similar principles for hundreds of millions of years, generating electromagnetic fields through high-frequency wing vibration. Azure Space Group is reverse-engineering and scaling these natural mechanisms to create revolutionary spacecraft propulsion.

### Innovative Funding Approach

Azure Space Group employs a hybrid funding model that combines traditional equity investments with an innovative tokenization strategy:

| Approach | Key Features | Benefits |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Traditional Equity | Staged investment rounds from seed to pre-IPO | Institutional backing, traditional governance |
| [Tokenization Strategy](/docs/tokenization-strategy) | Multi-token system with research, quantum, and governance tokens | Community engagement, decentralized research funding |

Our tokenization approach creates a powerful ecosystem that accelerates R&D through community involvement while providing unique opportunities for investors to participate in both the equity and token economies. For detailed information, see our [Tokenization Strategy](/docs/tokenization-strategy).
