### Distributed Research Infrastructure

To accelerate breakthrough discoveries, we complement our traditional R&D with two innovative approaches:

#### Game-Based Research Platform

Our [Game-Based Research Platform](/docs/research-documentation/game-based-research-platform) transforms complex research challenges into interactive experiences that harness collective intelligence:

*Integration between Game-Based Research and Traditional R&D Workflows*

The game-based research platform has already contributed to several breakthroughs:
- Optimization of quantum field parameters through distributed simulation
- Novel metamaterial configurations discovered through collaborative gameplay
- Identification of unexpected quantum tunneling behaviors

#### Tokenized Research Incentives

Our [Tokenization Strategy](/docs/tokenization-strategy) provides economic incentives for research contributions through the Community Research Pool, aligning the interests of researchers, investors, and enthusiasts.

| Research Area | Token Incentive Model | Integration with Traditional R&D |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
