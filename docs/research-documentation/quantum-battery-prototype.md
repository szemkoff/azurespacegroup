## Revised Power Output Expectations

The power output of the quantum battery depends on multiple factors, and our revised approach acknowledges the speculative nature of the technology with more conservative estimates:

### Revised Power Output Estimation Framework

We calculate power based on:

P = η × A × E<sub>Casimir</sub> × γ × f<sub>confidence</sub>

Where:
- η = Energy conversion efficiency (photon → electricity)
- A = Total Casimir cavity surface area (m²)
- E<sub>Casimir</sub> = Potential zero-point energy interaction
- γ = Photon emission rate per second
- f<sub>confidence</sub> = Confidence factor for experimental validation

### Phase-wise Scaling Estimates - Revised

| Scaling Phase | Casimir Area (m²) | Expected Measurement | System Output | Confidence Level | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Initial Demo) | 0.001 | Detectable signal | 0.1 - 1 W | Proof of concept | Focus on signal detection rather than useful power |
| Phase 2 (Lab Prototype) | 0.01 | 1 - 5 W | 20 - 50 W | Basic validation | Hybrid system with conventional power sources |
| Phase 3 (Advanced Prototype) | 0.1 | 5 - 20 W | 50 - 100 W | Efficiency mapping | Investigating scaling relationships |
| Phase 4 (Scaled System) | 1.0 | 20 - 100 W | 200 - 500 W | Performance validation | If Phase 1-3 results support continuation |
| Phase 5 (Commercial Prototype) | 10.0 | 200 - 500 W | 1 - 5 kW | Commercial viability | Only if previous phases show positive results |

### Detailed Expectations for Initial Phases

## Implementation Strategy
